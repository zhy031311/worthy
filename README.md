# worthy
Replacement for my previous stock tracker in Go.

`worthy` itself tracks various assets based on a JSON description,
prints their value and logs it in a CSV file.
Its main file is in `worthy/main/worthy.go`.

You aren't seriously expecting me to document this, are you? No README for you (yet). Have fun.
